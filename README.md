This student project replicates the main results of [Ethnic Diversity and Preferences for Redistribution]( https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/665800) by Dahlberg, Edmark and Lundqvist (2012). The paper examines the causal effect of increased ethnic heterogeneity in the Swedish society in the 1980’s and 90’s on preferred levels of social benefits among the native population. The original graphic and regression data has been provided by the [Swedish National Data Service]( https://doi.org/10.5878/001111). 

The project focusses on the incorporation of the research issue into the potential outcome framework and provides a critical assessment of the identification strategy used by the authors. The replication of the original results includes graphical analyses of the data, treatment effect estimations as well as additional analyses to investigate threats to identification. The additional contribution consists of the discussion of further threats to validity of the treatment effect estimate as well as a simulation study that is performed to study those.
